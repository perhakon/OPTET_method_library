 lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>While designing or developing the system, threats the may compromise its activities should be identified and&#xD;
addressed. Addressing these threats may include eliminating the threat source, implementing controls that reduce the&#xD;
likelihood of threat happening, implementing controls that allows system recovery or just accept the threats without doing&#xD;
any actions.&lt;/span></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The steps may get complicated and automation would be very beneficial&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The analyser may use different methods for identifying threats. The analyser should add any threats to the database&#xD;
        once they are identified.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is important to keep the knowledge base up to date, but also the risk analyser should keep in mind that new&#xD;
        threats appear all the time and should have a plan to deal with such threats as they arise.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>

Identify the system in question and the scope of it. This requires understanding of the purpose and the functions of the&#xD;
system. Scoping the system is crucial for the consequent tasks in order to cover all the assets and threats.&lt;/span></sectionDescription>

Decompose the system into assets. A typology of assets is usually provided by risk management methodologies. Asset&#xD;
models&amp;nbsp;help with this task.&lt;/span></sectionDescription>

Identify the threats the may compromise the asset functions. The threats are pulled from an existing knowledge base. The&#xD;
base is not static and can be updated whenever a new threat appears or whenever a new consequence (in terms of asset&#xD;
functionality) is chosen to be of interest.&lt;/span></sectionDescription>

Controls that block or mitigate threats are also provided in the knowledge base. If the system is automated, the required&#xD;
controls and their types (e.g. preventive or corrective) are provided alongside the identified threats. The analyser can&#xD;
choose the controls to be implemented according to their effectiveness and feasibility.&lt;/span></sectionDescription>

The analyser may not need to address all the threats. Some threats are very unlikely or their consequence is very low to&#xD;
justify investing in controls. If this is the case, the analyser should take an informed decision to accept these residual&#xD;
risks and possibly keeps monitoring them in case the situation changes.&lt;/span></sectionDescription>
