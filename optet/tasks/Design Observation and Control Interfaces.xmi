  <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There may be more than one control that can be activated for mitigating a particular threat.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The observation of threat activity may only be possible by indirect observation of an assetâ€™s trustworthiness&#xD;
        properties. In some cases, the cause of the threat may be external to the STS, and thus not directly observable.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Trust beliefs may likewise be hard to observe directly. Trust-related properties of e.g. a user should be observed&#xD;
        by focusing on trustee behaviour in interactions with trusted assets, which can be observed by interfaces of the&#xD;
        (software) assets.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each trustworthy asset, identify trustworthiness properties that are measurable and can be used as indicators for&#xD;
    the presence or absence of threats at runtime. To this end, software properties, which can be reported or observed at&#xD;
    runtime by respective interfaces, are defined. These properties can be used as parameters for calculating&#xD;
    trustworthiness metrics.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Since threat activity is usually not directly visible in a running system, it may help to think in terms of&#xD;
    misbehaviours that the asset could expose at runtime (e.g., underperformance). The runtime trustworthiness maintenance&#xD;
    should be able to identify misbehaviours based on the symptoms reported in the form of system trustworthiness&#xD;
    properties.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each trustworthy asset, design an interface to transmit its trustworthiness properties to the runtime&#xD;
    trustworthiness monitor. To this end, consider the trustworthiness properties that have been defined for each threat,&#xD;
    and can be considered as misbehaviour symptoms to be observed by the runtime maintenance. The asset may either be&#xD;
    designed to report the property values periodically to the trustworthiness maintenance, or offer an interface to query&#xD;
    these properties.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
