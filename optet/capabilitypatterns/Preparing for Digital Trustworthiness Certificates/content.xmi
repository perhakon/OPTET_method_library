  <mainDescription>This activity is carried out at design time with the goal of producing a DTwC that provides trustworthiness assurances on a&#xD;
software in two different ways.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
The first consists of disclosing a softwareâ€™s architecture and its relevant assets, threat model and providing controls to&#xD;
contrast the latter.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
The second is represented by a number of evidences, collected during the certification evaluation process, that support the&#xD;
claims about the presence/implementation of trustworthiness attributes, controls and so on.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
Therefore, it is important that a TwByD software development process is structured in a way to incorporate trustworthiness&#xD;
attributes from the very beginning of the development phase and to document this process to produce information for the&#xD;
creation of a DTwC.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <purpose>Provide trustworthiness assurances of a software/service at design time (and as a basis of measurement at runtime) in the&#xD;
form of a machine readable and understandable artefact.</purpose>
  <howtoStaff>This activity is performed at design time by the system trustworthiness architect with some automated aspects and should be&#xD;
used at runtime by the system trustworthiness monitor.</howtoStaff>
  <scope>preparation done in design time and output used as basis for runtime and audit purposes</scope>
  <usageNotes>During design time the capability is partially automated to capture and assemble the necessary trustworthiness information.</usageNotes>
