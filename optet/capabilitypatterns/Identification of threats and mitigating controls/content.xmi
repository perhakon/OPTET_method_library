This activity is carried out during the design time of the system. The system designer/developer can use this capability in&#xD;
order to identify the threats to the system assets and choose controls that mitigate these threats.&lt;span&#xD;
style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span> The capability relies on a knowledge base of threats mapped to asset types. The&#xD;
designer/developer should go through the identification process whenever a new threat is included in the knowledge base or&#xD;
asset changed (added/removed). The architecture and topology of asset combination is also a trigger of this process. The&#xD;
process can also be carried out after the design of the system during runtime, if system is dynamic (i.e. new assets&#xD;
added/removed dynamically). Furthermore, the process should also be followed for auditing and certification purposes, in&#xD;
order to verify that the required controls were implemented.&lt;/span></mainDescription>

The solution provided by OPTET to support this Capability Pattern simplifies and automates the threat identification&#xD;
process. The goal is to allow System designers who are not risk experts to use the tool and identify threats as well as&#xD;
controls.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/span></keyConsiderations>

different control possibilities are investigated and chosen according to feasibility and effectiveness criteria.</usageNotes>

        The steps may get complicated and automation would be very beneficial&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The analyser may use different methods for identifying threats. The analyser should add any threats to the database&#xD;
        once they are identified.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is important to keep the knowledge base up to date, but also the risk analyser should keep in mind that new&#xD;
        threats appear all the time and should have a plan to deal with such threats as they arise.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

 lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>While designing or developing the system, threats the may compromise its activities should be identified and&#xD;
addressed. Addressing these threats may include eliminating the threat source, implementing controls that reduce the&#xD;
likelihood of threat happening, implementing controls that allows system recovery or just accept the threats without doing&#xD;
any actions.&lt;/span></refinedDescription>
