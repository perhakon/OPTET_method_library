  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Digital Trustworthiness Certificate (DTwC) is a machine-readable and understandable artefact that captures the&#xD;
    relevant information about the trustworthiness of a service/software. It provides trustworthiness assurance on a&#xD;
    software in two different ways.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The former consists in disclosing softwareâ€™s architecture and relevant assets, as well as its threat model and the&#xD;
        means to contrast its challenges, from controls to trustworthiness attributes, explicitly defining the assets on&#xD;
        which they operates.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The latter is represented by a number of evidences, collected during the certification evaluation process, that&#xD;
        support the claims about the presence/implementation of trustworthiness attributes, controls and so on.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore, it is important that a TwByD software development process is structured in a way to incorporate&#xD;
    trustworthiness attributes from the very beginning of the development phase, and to document this process to produce&#xD;
    information for the creation of a DTwC.&#xD;
